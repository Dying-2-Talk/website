        <p class="paragraph">
          Dying to Talk was set up to help you feel more comfortable around the subject of death and dying. So, these
          resources and activities were designed by 20 young people 14-19 years - recruited to be Ambassadors for the
          project - to help you start those conversations with your classmates, family and friends.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="why" class="h4">Why does the project matter?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Death, dying and bereavement affect us all; it is a fact of life, but young people often lack the language
          and confidence to talk about it. This is partly because adults are generally not very good at talking to young
          people about death. Not being able to talk about death, dying and bereavement can create mental health
          problems – and other issues – in the future.

      <!-- <section>
        <h2 id="who" class="h4">What do we do?</h2>
        <p>
          These resources have been designed for every young person – if you can write, colour, take a photograph,
          listen to music – then you can use them. It depends on how you want to express yourself!
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="how" class="h4">What do we do?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          These resources and activities have been designed by young people to help you express their grief, talk about
          death and dying, or to learn how to show compassion to others.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          There are different activities to help you express yourself in the way that feels comfortable to you. That
          might be through Art, Music, Dance, Writing, Preparing Food, Taking or looking at Photographs, Colouring, what
          to think about when wandering through a graveyard!
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          There is also a book, “Ellis the Elephant”, that you or your parents or carers might like to share with
          younger siblings!
