# Dying 2 Talk

This project results from a partnership between the Universities of Bradford and Wolverhampton and Child Bereavement UK. Funded by AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council), it aimed to co-produce resources with young people – for young people – to prompt conversations about death, dying and bereavement.
